 $72.1, --> \\73
$73, Guerrilla Games Was Founded In 2000, Lost Boys Games Fused With 3 Other Company’s. /nThese Are Named: Formula Games, Orange Games And Digital Infinity.
 $73.1, --> \\74
$74, Today Guerrilla Games Counts Over 130 Employees And Growing. /nGuerrilla Games Is A So Called AAA Developer, /nIt Produces Games Directly For Sony And Is Known All Around The World.
 $74.1, --> \\75
$75, Because Guerrilla Games Is Now Ownership From Sony Computer Entertainment Europe (SCEE), /nGuerrilla Only Makes Games For Sony Platforms.
 $75.1, --> \\76
$76, Guerrilla Games Has Made 3 Games In The Past. /nFirst Started With The Multiplatform Game: Shellshock ’69: Vietnam...
 $76.1, --> \\77
$77, After That Game They Were Bought Over By SCEE, And Only Developed For Sony Consoles And Handhelds. /nTheir Next Game Was Killzone For Playstation 2...
 $77.1, --> \\78
$78, A While After This They Shipped Killzone: Liberation For PSP, /nBut In The Meanwhile They Were Allready (And Still Are) In Development Of Killzone 2, /nThe Flagship Title For Playstation 3.
 $78.1, --> \\79

--- TOOLS MAN

$100, Hey There! /nI can Tell You All About The Tools Being Used Around Here. /nCare To Hear The Story?
 $100.1, No, I've Heard About The Tools Already, Thanks. \\101
 $100.2, Yeah Sure, I'm Interested. \\102
$101, Ok, Well, If You Care To Hear It Sometime Again, /nYou Know Where To Find Me.
$102, Great! There Are Several Tools Being Used As A Level Designer.
 $102.1, --> \\ 103
$103, What Tool Do You Want To Know More About?
 $103.1, Perforce (P4V) \\105
 $103.2, Ultra-Edit \\108
 $103.3, LUA Statemachine Editor \\111
 $103.4, Maya \\114
 $103.5, I Know All These Tools, Thank You. \\104
$104, That's Great News! If However You Want To Get To Know Some More... /nCome See Me!
$105, Perforce Is The Software Used To Store Backups And Work With ALL Files That Have Something To Do With The Game.
 $105.1, --> \\106
$106, Whenever Someone Wants To Work On A Specific File, He Or She Checks It Out From Perforce /n(Thus Not Allowing Others To Work On It At The Same Time), Edit’s It The Way It’s Needed, And Checks It In Again.
 $106.1, --> \\107
$107, Perforce Keeps A History Of Old Files, /nAnd Anyone Using Perforce On Our Network Can Now Get The Latest File Updated By Other People. /nThis Way People Are Up-To-Date With The Newest Killzone Game.
 $107.1, --> \\ 103
$108, In Short It's Being Used To Edit .coretext Files.
 $108.1, --> \\109
$109, For Example We Use It To Implement Guns And Characters Into A Level, /nOr Set Fog On Or Off, All These Kinds Of Things, Are Edited In A .coretext File.
 $109.1, --> \\110
$110, These .coretext Files Are Opened (And Again, Edited As Well) With Ultra-Edit.
 $110.1, --> \\ 103
$111, In The LUA Editor, All Scripting For The Levels Is Being Handled, /nFrom Here All Enemies Spawn, And All Their Behavior Is Set.
 $111.1, --> \\112
$112, Environment Things, Like Rotating Cable Cogwheels Are Handled From This As Well.
 $112, --> \\113
$113, The Editor Is A Visual Reference Of All Your Functions. /nThere Are Grey Blocks In Which You Can Write Code That The Engine Executes. /nThey Can All Be Linked Together As Well To Make Some Big Events, Where A Lot Of Things Are Going On.
 $113.1, --> \\ 103
$114, Maya Is The Main 3D Package Used To Create Everything You See In-Game. /nParticles, Enemies, Weapons, And Levels Are All Done In Maya. /nGuerrilla Games Uses A Fully Customized Maya Version.
 $114.1, --> \\115
$115, Guerrilla uses Another Tool Inside Maya To Keep Track Of All The Files In A Level, Called The Project Manager. /nYou Can Turn On And Off Different Layers, Each Layer Is Another Maya File That Is Being Loaded Into The Scene Then.
 $115.1, --> \\116
$116, Project Manager Also Tells If A File Has Been Checked Out /n(From Perforce, And Thus Being Unable To Use It Yourself), And What Version Of The File It Is.
 $116.1, --> \\117
$117, Before Every Layer There Are 3 Letters, A, R And C. /nIf You Click The “A” You Activate The Layer (Also Automatically Checks It Out From Perforce, Making It Unable For Others To Mess With It), /nFrom There On You Can Edit It How You Like.
 $117.1, --> \\118
$118, The “R” Is For Referencing The Layer. /nThis Loads All The Files In The Maya Scene, But You Can’t Touch Or Edit Them, /nThis Is Useful When You Need To Know Where For Instance Markers Have To Be Placed On Your Level Geometry.
 $118.1, --> \\119
$119, The “C” Is A Bit More Special. /nIn Certain Cases You Need To Have Collision Inside Maya, When You Place Waypoints For Example, /nYou Want Them To Be On The Geometry, And Not Somewhere In The Air, This Is Where You Use This.
 $119.1, --> \\120
$120, So Besides Placing Markers And Editing Geometry, To Fit Your Game Idea’s, This Tool Is Used Most Of The Time.
 $120.1, --> \\121
$121, Another Tool We Recently Got, Is The Assets Database (aka. AssetsDB). /nThis Tool Helps Us Place Objects In Maya, And Create An Environment That Looks Filled With Objects Real Fast.
 $121.1, --> \\122
$122, With This Program, You Can Select Any Object From The List, And Place It With A Single Click Inside Maya, /nWhere It Automatically Is Placed On The Height The Floor In-Game Is Created At.
 $122.1, --> \\103

--- FINAL WORDS
$500, During The Last 5 Months, I Learned A Lot Of New Stuff. Besides All The Work I've Done For Level Design, /nI Have Studied A Lot Of Things In My Spare Time.
 $500.1, --> \\501
$501, Every Opportunity That Was There To Learn A New Aspect, I've taken. /nBesides The Library Of Books On All Sorts Of Topics We Got, /nI Took Some Time To Sit Down With People, And Ask Them Specific Questions.
 $501.1, --> \\502
$502, I Went Over To Texture Art, And Asked Several Questions To Point Me Out How To Make A Unique Style. /nAs You Have Seen, I Made This Report In A Cartoon Style, Everything Was Done By Hand.
 $502.1, --> \\503
$503, I Went Over To Environment Art, And Asked Them Several Questions On Modelling Techniques. /nThis Severely Speeded Up The Process For Me, I Eventually Modelled And Textured The First Part Of The Level In Just 3 Days. /nThis Was From Concept To Finalisation.
 $503.1, --> \\504
$504, Because The Job Of A Level Designer Is So Broad, During The 2nd Period Of My Internship, /nI Got In Touch With So Many New Things, I Keep Learning Every Time Again. This Is Definatly Something I Want To Continue/n And Make A Career With, Atleast I'm Going One Step Into The Right Direction, I Got Offered A Contract.
 $504.1, --> \\505
$505, And Remember: /n/nYou Don’t Make Games To Become Rich, You Make Games To Live Up To Your Passion!

--- WHAT ELSE DID I LEARN

$520, Hello There.
 $520.1, --> \\521
$521, I Have Collected Information About What Else Dennis Has Learned During His Internship.
 $521.1, --> \\522
$522, Which Of The Following Are You Interested In?
 $522.1, LUA Syntax/Language \\523
 $522.2, Greater Communication Skills \\525
 $522.3, Gained Knowledge About "Crunchtime" \\526
 $522.4, I'm Familiar With /p's "What Else's". \\528
$523, LUA Scripting /nBecause I Have Been Put On Scripting Events The Last Period A Lot (And Fixing Old Ones), /nI Spend A Great Deal Of Time With These Scripts, And Learned A Lot Of Ins-And-Outs On This Topic.
 $523.1, --> \\524
$524, The Biggest Thing I Worked On Was Fixing All Of "Salamun District". /nEspecially In The Last Bit Of The Level There Were Some Fixes Required, /nIt Took Me Some Time To Figure Everything Out, But Eventually I Got Everything Working In Time Again.
 $524.1, --> \\522
$525, Communication Skills /nDue To The Company's Multinational Employees, You Are Required To Speak English. /nBecause Of This I Got To Speak English At A Really Fluent Level, And It Has Become More Of My 2nd Language.
 $525.1, --> \\522
$526, Crunchtime /nWith All The Deadlines We Had To Make, Naturally, Crunchtime Was Included Here. /nI Have Been Working Several Weekends As Well, Just To Help Out My Colleagues.
 $526.1, --> \\527
$527, Crunchtime Is The Period Between Now And A Deadline, /nMost Of The Time This Goes Paired With Offering Your Spare-Time Though. /nI Had A Big One For Playstation Day '08, Where Level 2 (Corinth River) Had To Be Finished.
 $527.1, --> \\522
$528, Ok, Let Me Know If There Is Anything Else I Can Tell You About.


--- MY JOB(S)

$530, Hello, I'm Here To Explain The Various Things /p Did As A Level Designer.
 $530.1, --> \\531
$531, Are You Interested In Hearing Any Of This?
 $531.1, no, I'm Already Familiar With This. \\532
 $531.2, Yes, Sure Thing! \\533
$532, Well, If You Ever Want To Hear It Again, Let Me Know.
$533, Great, Let Me Tell You All About It...
 $533.1, --> \\534
$534, As A Level Designer, You Get To Work On A Very Broad Range Of Things. /nBut Generally You Are Implementing Gameplay Elements, Rather Then Anything Visual.
 $534.1, --> \\535
$535, /p's Share Of Level Design Has Mostly Consisted Out Of 2 Things, /nThese 2 Things Are What /p Has Mastered During His Internship; /nMockup Motion capture And LUA Scripting.
 $535.1, --> \\536
$536, In The Beginning Of The Process Of Creating A Level, Several Things Are Needed. /nOne Of Which Is Animation. To Produce This Real Fast, Guerrilla Bought A Special Suit. /nThis Suit Is A Dutch Design, And Is Called Moven-Suit, By The Company "Moven".
 $536.1, --> \\537
$537, With This Suit, If Anybody Puts It On, The Movement A Person Does Is Recorded Realtime In 3D. /nThis Way You Dont Have To Hire A Full Studio And Expensive Mocap Actors To Have Some Mockup Done. /n/p Has Done Some Of These Animations For Several Levels.
 $537.1, --> \\538
$538, There Is A Recording Of The Mockup Motion Capture Initialisation /p Did. /nDo You Want To View This?
 $538.1, No, Let Us Move Along. \\540
 $538.2, Yeah, Let Me See. \\539
 $538.3, I've Actually Heard Enough, Thanks. \\548
$539, I Hope You Liked That...
$539.script: DS_displayTest
 $539.1, --> \\540
$540, Let Me Tell You About LUA Scripting And A Bit Of It's History.
 $540.1, --> \\541
$541, "Lua" (Pronounced LOO-ah) Means "Moon" In Portuguese. /nLua Is Designed, And Maintained By A Team At PUC-Rio, The Pontifical Catholic University Of Rio De Janeiro In Brazil. /nLua Was Born And Raised At Tecgraf, The Computer Graphics Technology Group Of PUC-Rio.
 $541.1, --> \\542
$542, Lua Is Currently The Leading Scripting Language In Games. /nThe Reason For This Is It's Really Small, Takes Allmost No Processing Power, And Is Easy To Embed In Your Game.
 $542.1, --> \\543
$543, Besides Killzone 2, There Are A Lot Of Other Games That Use Lua. /nA Small Fraction Of These Are: SimCity4, Crysis/FarCry, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. And Even Psychonauts. /nThis List Can Go On For A little Little While, But As You Can See, It's A Global Used Language.
 $543.1, --> \\544
$544, All Events (Think Spawning Enemies, Controlling Them And Even Smaller In-Game Cutscenes) Are Controlled Via Lua. /nAll This Is Done By Our In-House Lua Editor; Statemachine Editor. /nThis Editor Let's You Write All These Events Down, And When Youre Done, Exports It To A File-Format The Engine Can Read.
 $544.1, --> \\545
$545, This Has To Be Done, Otherwise The Engine, That Uses Aa Special Fileformat (.coretext Files), /nWont Be Able To Process The Events Made Up By The Level Designer.
 $545.1, --> \\546
$546, In Summary, What Lua Is And Does, /nIs Process It's Scripting Language Into In-Game Events That The Player Will Eventually See And Experience. /nThat's Why This Is The Most Important Step For Level Designers, As This Is What Makes Or Breaks The Game.
 $546.1, --> \\547
$547, That's About It, Did You Get It, Or Is There A Topic You Want To Hear Again?
 $547.1, Motion Capture \\536
 $547.2, Lua Scripting \\541
 $547.3, No, I'm All Updated, Thanks A Lot. \\548
$548, Thank You For Taking Your Time For Me, Come Again...
